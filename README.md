There are 2 versions:

## Version 1
A static version, nothing more than the task requires.
Under app/modules/client-form

## Version 2
A dynamic version (mostly) to cover all possibly upcoming changes (requested by client, etc).
Good example for a big project, where you will have to add more steps to the form.
Maybe a bit over engineering, but I like this approach.
