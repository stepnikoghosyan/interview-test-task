## Description
Implemented a dynamic version (mostly) to cover all possibly upcoming changes (requested by client, etc).
Good example for a big project, where you will have to add more steps to the form.
Maybe a bit over engineering for the current task, but I like this approach, it'll be much better for real project, especially a big one.

- haven't completed some parts, the implemented part is enough xD
